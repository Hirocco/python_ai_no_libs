# Project Dependencies

This project utilizes several libraries and packages for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and building a neural network. Below is a list of dependencies along with their descriptions:

## Python Libraries

- **NumPy**: NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

- **pandas**: pandas is an open-source data analysis and manipulation library that provides data structures like DataFrames for data handling.

- **scikit-learn**: scikit-learn is a machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.

## Data Preprocessing and Loading

- **data_preparation**: This is a custom module for data preprocessing and loading. It may include functions for data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing.

- **data_loading**: Another custom module that contains data loading functions.

## Perceptron Algorithm

- **perceptron_algorithm**: This directory contains custom modules related to the Perceptron algorithm, including the neural network and neuron implementations.

## Usage

To use these libraries and packages in your project, it's recommended to set up a Python environment using tools like `virtualenv` or `conda`. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

You should also include the custom modules provided in your project directory.
